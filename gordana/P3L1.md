## Software Architecture

A blueprint of the software system that includes the structure, the behavior, the interaction and non-functional properties. It is built iteratively, over time and it changes

* Prescriptive architecture - design decisions made prior to building the system
* Descriptive architecture - describing the architecture how the system has been built

**They often end up being different**

Architecture evolution

In theory we would first change the prescriptive architecture and then build accordingly, but that rarely happens. We most often modify the system as we go, which makes the descriptive architecure diverge from the prescriptive.

Reasons:

* Developer sloppiness
* Time constraints
* Lack of documentation (There is no prescriptive architecture in place)

Good architectural design is:
* Scalable - can be easily expanded in the future
* Cohesive - the modules provide closely related functionality
* Decoupled - modules have low dependency on one another

**Architectural styles** - patterns in designing an architecture. Knowing them prevents reinventing the wheel over and over and repeating past mistakes. There are many style, some of them are:

* Pipes-and filters (output of one function is input to the next)
* Event-driven
* Publish-subscribe
* Client-server
* Peer-2-peer
* Representational State Transfer (REST) - very widely used, it is the architecture of the World Wide Web
