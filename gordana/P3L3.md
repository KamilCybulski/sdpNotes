## Design Patterns - general reusable solutions to common design problems

"Gang of Four" book "Design Patterns - elements of reusable OO Sofware"

General types of patterns: 

* Fundamental
* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioral 
* Concurrency

## Relation to our project

I think learning design patterns is very important, it is the next step after getting more advanced with a Object-Oriented programming language. They prevent reinventing the wheel over and over, and coming up with sub-optimal solutions to common problems.

I know there is a Udacity course on JavaScript design patterns I intend to take in the future.

At this point, I did not understand the details of any of the patterns mentioned, so I think I am not quite ready to tackle learning them. But, a good starting point would be to get familiar with the anti-patterns in the next lessons and try to avoid them in our design.

Huh? Where are the lessons on anti-patterns? Seems like they are missing...
