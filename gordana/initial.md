## Sotware Development Phases

1. Requirements Engineering - establishing the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by sofrware
Set of steps - iterative process
* Elicitation
* Analysis
* Specification
* Verification
* Maintainance

2. Design
From high level to low level of the system

3. Implementation
4 pillars:
* Reduction of complexity
* Anticipation of diversity
* Design for testability
* Use of (external) standards

4. Verification and Validation (Testing)
* Did we build the right system?
* Did we build the system right?

5. Maintainance
* Corrective (Fixing bugs)
* Perfective (New features)
* Adaptive (New Enviroments - libraries, OS etc.)

## Software lifecycle model
Determines the order of the activities and the transition criteria
1. Waterfall model

* Pros: Finds errors early
* Con: It is not flexible

2. Spiral model - iterative 

* Pros: Risk reduction, Adding functionality is easy..
* Cons: Risk evaluation requires expertise, can be costly

3. Evolutionary Prototyping 

* Pros: Immediate feedback
* Cons: Difficult to plan

4. Rational Unified Process (RUP)

5. Agile (group of methods)

* TDD 
* Extreme programming
* SCRUM
