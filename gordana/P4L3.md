### White-Box testing (structural testing)

Advantages:
* based on the code, so the quality of the testing can be measured objectively (black-box is more subjective) and automatically
* can be used to compare test suites

There are many different kinds:
* control-flow based - we will focus on this kind
* data-flow based
* fault-based
