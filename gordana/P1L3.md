## Main topics

This section is on IDE's, and focuses on Eclipse. 
Since we are not going to use Java and Eclipse, I think this entire section is not 
relevant and we should skip it.

However, we should discuss what is our development environment and which editor/IDE 
we are using.

I am on a Windows 10 machine.
I like experimenting with editors and IDE's. Currently my favorites are:

* VS Code - general purpose editor that has a very nice and clean Git integration and debugging tools as well.
* PHPStorm - it is a great IDE, I use it mostly for php but it is also an IDE for JavaScript development (It integrates all the WebStorm functionallity).
