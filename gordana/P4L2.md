### Black-Box Testing (Functional Testing)

Advantages:
* focuses on the domain 
* does not need the code makes early design possible
* catches logic defects
* applicable at all granularity levels

#### How do we get From Functional specification to Test Cases?
* We do it systematically:
    1. Identify **independently testable features**
    2. Identify **relevant inputs** - (Category-Partition Method - identify categories)
        * split the domain into partitions (partition categories into choices - interesting cases)
        * select input from each partition(identify constraints among choices - to eliminate meaningless combinations and reduce the number of test cases)
    3. Derive **test case specifications**
        * produces test frames
        * this step can be automated
    4. Generate **test cases**

Overall, I like this lesson, I think it gives a great systematic approach to black-box testing. I think it is important to adopt testing aware mindset, and think about an application in the terms of domain, inputs, outputs etc.(even if we are not actually going to implement testing at this point.) 

#### Category-Partition Demo

I especially liked the demo, and breaking down the app domain into categories and partitions. A developer should think about these and identify them regardless of testing in order to make the code robust, capable to handle various (fringe) cases.

* The demo uses a tool - TSLgenerator , which generates all possible test frames out of the category-partition-choices document.

* The number of test frames is reduced by adding:
    * constraints to eliminate meaningless combinations, 
    * error constraints (indicate a choice that corresponds with an error)
    * single constraints 

#### Model-based testing - Finite state machines

A model is an abstract representation of the software that we are testing

How do we build them?
    1. Identify system's boundaries, inputs and outputs
    2. Identify relevant states and transitions
