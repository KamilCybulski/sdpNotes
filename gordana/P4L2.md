### Black-Box Testing

Advantages:
* focuses on the domain 
* does not need the code makes early design possible
* catches logic defects
* applicable at all granularity levels

#### How do we get From Functional specification to Test Cases?
* We do it systematically:
    1. Identify **independently testable features**
    2. Identify **relevant inputs** - (Category-Partition Method - identify categories)
        * split the domain into partitions (partition categories into choices - interesting choices)
        * select input from each partition(identify constraints among choices - to eliminate meaningless combinations and reduce the number of test cases)
    3. Derive **test case specifications**
        * produces test frames
        * this step can be automated
    4. Generate **test cases**

Overall, I like this lesson, I think it gives a great systematic approach to black-box testing. I think it is important to adopt testing aware  mindset, and think about an application in the terms of domain, inputs, outputs etc.(even if we are not actually going to implement testing at this point.) 

I especially liked the demo, and breaking down the app domain into categories and partitions. A developer should think about these and identify them regardless of testing in order to make the code robust, capable to handle various (unexpected ) cases. (..to be continued)
