### Software Refactoring

* Milestone book by [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html): Improving the design of existing code. The book contains:
    * Catalog of refactorings - there are many
    * Bad smells
    * When to refactor
    * Before and after examples

1. Collapse hierarchy refactoring - when a subclass becomes too similar with the superclass -> merge them
2. Consolidate conditional statements with a same result, and make them a function
3. Decompose conditionals - if it is too complex, extract the condition into a method
4. Extract class -  if a class is doing to much, split it into smaller classes
5. Inline class - reverse of extract class
6. Extract method - method is too long and has many fragments. Split it into smaller methods

#### **There are tools in IDEs for code refactoring**

### When not to refactor

* When the code is broken
* When the deadlines are tight
* When there is no reason - the design is already good

### Bad Smells - symptoms that refactoring might be needed

* Duplicated code - copy/paste programming
* Long method
* Large class
* Shotgun surgery - one change needs many changes in other classes - they are tightly coupled 
* Feature envy - one class uses too many public methods defined in another class
