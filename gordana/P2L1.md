## Requirements engineering 

1. What are requirements?

* A description of what a system has to do, the features of a program, represented more (state diagrams) or less(user stories) formally.<br/>
*RE is establishing the services that are required by the customer from the software system.*

I found the explanation why it is called "requirements engineering" interesting - it is because it is a complex activity that involves a number of activities (elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, management) and it actually spans throughout the entire software development life cycle. 

The final result of the RE process is the **Software Requirements specification** - what should the system do, **NOT** how. (The how is detailed in the design stage) 

* Software intensive systems = software + hardware + context

When we build sofware, we have to consider all 3 aspects. (Not sure I understand the context part) What is the purpose of mentioning software intensive systems? Is it to make connection with the talk on sofware quality?

So, sofware runs on hardware and it is build for a purpose. The quality of the entire system is  a function of how good the sofware is(fast, bug free, provides good user experience) and how well it serves its purpose. 

**Identifying the purpose is at the core of the requirements engineering.**

Common problems with requirements:

* Completeness - important functionality is missing
* Pertinence - the system is bloated with irrelevant features
