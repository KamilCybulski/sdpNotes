## Requirements engineering 

1. What are requirements?

* A description of what a system has to do, the features of a program, represented more (state diagrams) or less(user stories) formally.<br/>
*RE is establishing the services that are required by the customer from the software system.*

I found the explanation why it is called "requirements engineering" interesting - it is because it is a complex activity that involves a number of activities (elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, management) and it actually spans throughout the entire software development life cycle. 

The final result of the RE process is the **Software Requirements specification** - what should the system do, **NOT** how. (The how is detailed in the design stage) 

* Software intensive systems = software + hardware + context

When we build sofware, we have to consider all 3 aspects. (Not sure I understand the context part)
