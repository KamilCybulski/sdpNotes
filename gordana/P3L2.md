## A Tale of Analysis and Design

This whole lesson is a demo of the process of analyzing requirements and modeling the class diagram on an example of library system.

I found this to be very useful, although it is an idealized scenario. I am not sure if it really happens like his in real life..Nonetheless, it was informative to have an overview of the process through an example.

Main takeaway is that the process is iterative: there are multiple refinements before the final design.
