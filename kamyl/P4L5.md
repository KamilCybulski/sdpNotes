## Refactoring

* maintain the same (external) behavior, while keeping
  program readable, maintainable and understandable

* Refactoring should result in some sort of improvement, dont
  refactor for the sake of refactoring

* Types of refactoring - theres a lot, no point in listing them

* Refactoring is not a way to fix code, it's about improving code.
  If it was broken before, you don't refactor, you fix stuff.

* Bad smells - weaknesses (not bugs!) of your code, like code duplicates,
  bloated functions, bloated objects etc.
