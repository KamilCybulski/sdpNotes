##Requirements gathering

So this is a phase where we gather all the requirements of our software. It 
should be a not-too-detailed description of how the whole program should work
from the user's perspective. We should avoid any implementation-related
discussion here. 

I was a bit surprised when I watched an interview video. It seems to me
that a customer should not really care about the programming language used,
not in this case anyway.
