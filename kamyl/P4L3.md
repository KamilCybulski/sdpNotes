## White-box testing

- testing based on examining the code

- few different variations:
    * control-flow based
    * data-flow based
    * fault based

- Coverage criteria - defined in terms of test requirements, which is just
                      a fancy name for an executable chunk of code, results
                      in test spec + test cases. 

- Test case is just a pair (kinda like key-value) of inputs and outputs.
  It's nicely written in this format: (input)(output). In both cases you
  your variables and put values in []. So, for example:
  (a = [1], b = [2])(sum = [3]);

- Statement coverage - statements tested / statements in the program. 
                       But you can also have branch coverage (in FCG) or
                       condition coverage (also in CFG);

- Flow control graphs - Basically it looks like a map of a possible options
                        within a program.

- Honestly it seems to me that they have spent quite a lot of time
  explaining somewhat simple idea of covering all possible "routes" your
  program can go - wether you call them branches, conditions, statements, 
  it seems to me that it's all the same thing, the difference lays in some
  accents.

- MC/DC - test only important combinations of conditions.
