This section is about git, so I don't expect too many new concepts.
I will put here only the stuff that is new, or I consider worth noting
(mostly because I have not been paying enough attention to them so far)

- The central repository should contain only the files necessary for 
  production that cannot be obtained by other measures. So no complied
  files, no dependecies, no cache files etc. We should pay some extra 
  attention to our .gitignore file.

- not much more really.
