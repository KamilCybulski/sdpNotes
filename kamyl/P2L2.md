Yeah, this section doesn't seem to apply to our project. The way they 
described OO here was focused on classes, and the whole UML things is 
apparently concern with classes either. And we definitely will not be using
those, not in a traditional sense anyway.

- Some of the notes on component diagram structure might be adaptable
  to our project though. Since we will be using a component-based frontend 
  framework, we might want to do a similar diagram for our component structure.

- Behavioral diagrams seem to be intended for a much more complicated
  system then ours.

- Some of the notes on state transition diagrams sound applicable to our 
  project too. We might want (in a lower level spec) describe possible states
  of our statefull components.

- So, all in all, we might want to do a spec that describes the whole
  component structure, their interactions and relation and possible states
  (and what those states indicate)
  It might be advisable since I have noticed that React components have 
  a nasty tendency to have a very bloated state, along with a long-as-hell
  list of methods, which is very messy.
