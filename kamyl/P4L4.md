## AGILE!

Key outtakes:
* Focus on the code
* Value ppl over process 
* Iterative approach
* Customer involvement 
* Expectation that specification will change
* Do as simple as possible

### Extreme Programming (XP)
* small to medium sized teams
* use this if requirements are vague and will probably change
* Principles:
    1. Communication - pair programming, user stories, so on so on
    2. Simplicity - look for the most simple solution that works
    3. Feedback - from customers and other devs
    4. If code doesn't work - drop it

* Practices:
    1. Incremental planning - requirements are specified as use cases or smth 
       like that. The whole development process is a cycle of specifying some
       use cases, breaking them into tasks, planning release, developing code,
       testing, releasing, rinse and repeat
    
    2. Small releases - Each release adds just a few functionalities at once

    3. Simple design - use the simplest solution that meets the requirements.

    4. Test first - if there is a feature, there should be a test written 
       before you start working on the feature. No test, no feature.

    5. Refactoring - self explanatory

    6. Pair programming - sounds cool, but I don't know if it would be as cool
       in everyday production

    7. Continuos integration - integrate (meaning commit and push? ;P ) as 
       often as possible

    8. On-site customer - customer is an active member of the team. Sounds
       like a god-damn nightmare

* Requirements are written as scenarios or user stories by customer mostly

* Testing should be automated

* 2 kinds of tests:
    1. units tests -> developer testing his/her implementation of a particular
       user story/task

    2. system test -> test cases provided by users, and implemented
       (automated) by developers


### Scrum

* Actors:
    1. Product owner (customer) - provides backlog (user stories etc)
    2. Team - self organized, small, does the main work
    3. Scrum master - MC of the whole process

* Process:
    1. Product backlog (the whole description of the product)
    2. Sprint planning (pick some items from the backlog)
    3. Sprint backlog 
    4. Sprint (one iteration of the process)
    5. Sprint review
    6. Potential release (internal or external)
