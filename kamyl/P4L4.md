## AGILE!

Key outtakes:
* Focus on the code
* Value ppl over process 
* Iterative approach
* Customer involvement 
* Expectation that specification will change
* Do as simple as possible

Extreme Programming (XP)
* small to medium sized teams
* use this if requirements are vague and will probably change
* Principles:
    1. Communication - pair programming, user stories, so on so on
    2. Simplicity - look for the most simple solution that works
    3. Feedback - from customers and other devs
    4. If code doesn't work - drop it

* Practices:
    1. Incremental planning - requirements are specified as use cases or smth 
       like that. The whole development process is a cycle of specifying some
       use cases, breaking them into tasks, planning release, developing code,
       testing, releasing, rinse and repeat
    
    2. Small releases - Each release adds just a few functionalities at once

    3. Simple design - use the simplest solution that meets the requirements.

    4. Test first - if there is a feature, there should be a test written 
       before you start working on the feature. No test, no feature.

    5. Refactoring -
