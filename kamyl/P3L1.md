## Software architecture

- It's a blueprint of a software system
    1. Structure
    2. Behavior
    3. Interactions
    4. Non-functional props
    I'm not exactly sure what is the difference between 1. and 2. It would
    seem to me that 'behavior' is how the system behaves outside (user 
    perspective), while interactions define how each element of the system
    plays with others

- In general SA is concerned only with important design decisions (however
  we define 'important').

- SA is an iterative process 

- Prescriptive vs descriptive SA
    1. Prescriptive - created prior to building, answers the question "how
       the system should be built"

    2. Descriptive - created after, describes what we actually have managed to
       build.

    Not surprisingly those 2 rarely look the same at the end of the whole thing

- Architectural degradation
    1. Architectural drift - when we add stuff that wasn't included in 
                             prescriptive description and don't really fit the 
                             the whole thing. 

    2. Architectural erosion - when we add stuff that clearly violates our
                               prescriptive description

- Architectural recovery - well, they don't really say **how** to do it...

### SA elements

1. Processing elements - contain all the logic      // Components
2. Data elements - contain data                     // Components

3. Interaction elements - manage interaction between different elements
                            (what about users?)     // Connectors


- Component is an entity that encapsulates some functionalities or data
  They also provide interface for that functionalities

- Connector... well, again, manages interaction

- Configuration is a structure builded from components and connectors
  Configuration examples look scarily complex...

- Deployment architectural perspective - Configuration mapped to hardware

### SA styles

1. Pipes and filters - a chain of components, basically.

2. Event driven - a bunch of events that trigger specific reaction

3. Publish/subscribe - I have no idea what that is supposed to mean. Twitter
                       example makes sense and has some connection with the
                       the name, but the explanation sounded like gibberish
                       to me...

4. Client/server - each device assumes a role of either server (provider) or 
                   consumer (request sender)...

5. P2P - ???

6. REST - Representational State Transfer, a mix of previous styles, used in
          www
