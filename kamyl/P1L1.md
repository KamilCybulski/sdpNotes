Not really much in this section. Some historical stuff + trying to convince
you that you need to pay more attention to your work proccess.

The interesting stuff starts with `Software phases` video. 
The process described there goes as follows:
1. Reqirement's engeneering
2. Design
3. Implementation 
4. Verification and validation
5. Maintenance 

What surprises me is the lack of much more detailed technical description.
They have stated that design is a high level description, but I would
say once you have this, you should create at least a general plan of how
your software will be working...
