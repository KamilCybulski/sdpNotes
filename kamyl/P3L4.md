## Design patterns

- Honestly, I'd say that design patterns are quite strongly correlated to 
  language you are using. Implementations may be very different, and 
  some of the patterns don't make much sense in certain languages.

- For example, factory method pattern doesn't make sense in JS, since
  we don't need classes at all to create objects

- Honestly this whole section seems very strongly tied to Java...
  or at least a java-like class oriented languages

- Things that ring a bell - decorator, iterator, proxy
