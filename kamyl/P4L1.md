## Rational Unified Process 

- RUP is concerned with the process of building software
  Two main features (or concepts...?):
  1. Software process model - describes the phases of building soft, 
     order of those phases and the transition criteria
  2. Component based - software consists of components. Important thing -
     you need interfaces for the components to interact with each other!

- Three distinctive traits: 
  1. Architecture centric - defines the form (structure) of the system. I'm not
     sure how this is a trait specific to RUP. I'd say defining a structure
     of a system is one of the most important things here, no matter what
     methodology you use. Anyway, the basic idea is to start with very general
     and high level description and iteratively expand it, by defining smaller
     and smaller parts of the system.
  2. Iterative and incremental - well, it's quite self-explaining, right? Each
     cycle should result with some upgrades, product release (!). Each cycle
     has four steps, that will be described below...
  3. Use-case driven - main accent is put on interaction with the user. Smells
     like user stories to me, to be honest.

- Tightly related to UML (...?)

- Honestly this course sounds more like a management course or something...

- Phases of each cycle:
  1. Inception - idea ---> vision of the end product. Should be much more
     specific then the initial idea, answer some basic (mostly business 
     related) question. They said it results in a lot of documents that do
     not seem relevant to our project. I mean, we could prepare then, but
     it looks like an overkill (and waste of time);
  2. Elaboration - should result in almost complete use-case model, some 
     initial software architecture, test cases, lower level design. This
     is also a moment to asses and change some docs prepared in the Inception
     phase (or other phases from previous iterations)
  3. Construction - WRITING CODE! Plus testing. This should result in a 
     product. Very often it's n internal product, but still...
  4. Transition - basically all the stuff that happens after deployment.
     From coding perspective, it's mostly maintenance.

- I am a bit lost about how those phases of each cycle interact
  with traditional phases of development process (RE, analysis and design...)

- All in all, this seems like a stuff for complex and expensive projects.
