## Black-box testing

- Advantages:
    1. Focuses on the input domain
    2. You don't need the code.
    3. Can catch logic defects.
    4. Applicable everywhere!

- BBT starts by creating some test cases from our functional spec. 
  In order to do that, we need to: 
  1. Identify independently testable features
  2. Identify relevant inputs
  3. Create test case spec
  4. Proceed to creating all the test cases

- Partition testing sounds interesting...
